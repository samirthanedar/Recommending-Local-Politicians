    "* This works better with words rather than topics because if you use topics the plotting becomes way more manual. Probably more accurate with Topics though??\n",
    "* Tried to see if 3D plotting seperates the candidates more. It's hard to say really. The one big difference is that Scott Weiner and Nancy Pelosi are now also separated from \"the pack\". They form almost this moderate grouping. Otherwise everything else is the same. Deanna, John, and Shahid are all separated from the pack. And everyone else is close together.\n"
